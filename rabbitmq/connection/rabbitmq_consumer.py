        Constructor.

        Creates instances of the RabbitMQConsumer class which is used to consume messages from a queue.

        Parameters
        ----------
        host : str
            The address of the RabbitMQ queue
        username: str
            The username used for authentication
        password: str
            The password used for authentication
        virtual_host: str
            The virtual host. Default: /
        receive_callback:
            The callback handler invoked when a message is received from the queue
        queue : str
            Name of the queue
        queue_arguments: dict
            Optional queue arguments to pass to the basic_consume operation (see AMQP documentation)
        consumer_arguments: dict
            Optional consumer arguments to pass to the basic_consume operation (see AMQP documentation)
        offset: str or int
            Value of offset to start consuming from (applies to stream-backed queue)
        prefetch_count: int
            Maximum number of unacknowledged messages that are permitted on the channel at a time; after the maximum
             is reached, sender will block
            until at least one of the messages is acknowledged. Default: 1000 (see AMQP documentation)
